# Hummingbird Technical Test
### This is a work in progress but I have to get back to my dissertation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To install: `git clone, yarn/npm install, yarn/npm start`.

`TODO:`
* Refactor state management with Redux store
    * Attempt to handle state within React hit a limit when crops by field would need 
    to be reset to correctly pass into 'potential yield' algorithm 
* Feed back crop-by-field selections into map and update rendered fields to reflect 
crop selection
* Polish UI
* Get back up to speed on React.  Too much bash automation scripts and Android/Java as of late :anguished:
